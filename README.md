# 🧩 Overview: Nutritea – Nutritional Support for People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

### :rocket: The Nutritea project aims to improve communication between caregivers and healthcare professionals involved in the care of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
Through a functional prototype developed in Figma, the platform demonstrates how caregivers could register the patient’s daily meals, track food acceptance or refusal, and share this data with professionals before medical appointments.

The main objective is to optimize the information flow and enhance the quality of care, reducing waiting times and helping professionals better understand the patient’s eating behavior in advance.

**Erik Guilherme Honorio de Souza** – *Scrum master*

**Gabrielle Mendes** – *Designer*

**Louise Martins Pereira** – *Back-End*

**Beatriz Borba Prazim** – *Front-End*

**Felipe Araújo** – *Researcher*

Each member contributed to research, ideation, and interface design to ensure that the proposed solution is intuitive, inclusive, and functional within the scope of digital prototyping.


## :computer: Technology Used

**Figma** – Used for prototyping, wireframing, and interface design.
This tool allowed the team to visually represent user flows, define system architecture, and create an interactive prototype to simulate the platform’s navigation and usability.
